Hello, welcome to the README file!

This project is personally made to control DMX lighting. Here's some information on the version and stuff:

Name: DMX Controller    
Version: 1.0.1    
Made By: TheIronCollector    
Date Released: 7-22-24 (US)    

This project is licensed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3

Updates will automatically be installed upon running if available and user is connected to the internet.    
To access the exe, you'll find it in the dist folder. Make sure to make a shortcut or something and add it to your desktop.    
(DONT ADD ANYTHING TO THE DIRECTORY EVEN AFTER DOWNLOADING. IT WILL BE DELETED UPON UPDATING)

Please allow this program to bypass any virus detectors. This is not a virus. If you don't believe this statement, feel free to look through the files. EXE's made with Python tend to falsely set them off.

Currently only works with DSD Tech USB to DMX adapters. For other USB to DMX adapters to be added, please mention in a discussion the brand, product ID (PID), and the vendor ID (VID). I will personally update the program to work with that product.
